## Excess Chemical Potential of Hydrophobes in Water  
Here is a simple method to implement test particle insertion (TPI) to estimate excess chemical potential. The cross interactions for hydrophobes in TIP4P/2005 are taken from "J. Phys. Chem. B 2020, 124, 6924âˆ’6942." Bulk water consisting of TIP4P/2005 was first equlibrated at constant pressure and constant temperature, then the TPI method was applied. In this code, I used parallelized computing of energy difference generated from inserting virtual atom randomly. I also have automized this appraoch using bash script, "config". By executing config, you can achieve excess chemical potentials of your interest system.
